**Full abstract:**

Collaborative dialogue can end with apparent agreement while participants still differ on goals, assumptions, or execution plans, creating an illusion of alignment (IoA). A real-user study across 18 meetings confirms that IoA arises routinely in human collaboration. Yet IoA poses a paradox: if participants were aware of such disagreements, they would already be explicit; if not, they cannot articulate them when asked, leaving IoA invisible to both participants and observers. In this work, we make IoA detectable by generating diagnostic multiple-choice questions whose divergent answers across participants provide direct behavioral evidence of hidden disagreement. We construct IoA-Suite, a dataset and evaluation protocol for detecting hidden disagreement, spanning five task types and six domains. We find that even the best model attains only 49.5% F1, with the bottleneck traced to private context that the dialogue does not surface. We then train IoA-Prober-8B based on IoA-Suite, reaching 51.8% F1 on IoA-Suite. Across the aforementioned 18 real meetings, it surfaces 2.89 hidden disagreements per meeting that participants confirm they had not voiced, transferring to live human dialogue. Further, in multi-agent collaboration, pairing IoA-Prober-8B with LLM agents improves downstream task performance on BigCodeBench-Hard and HiddenBench.
